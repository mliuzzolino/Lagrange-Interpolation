# Lagrange-Interpolation

## Introduction
This script utilizes Lagrange Polynomials for interpolation. The interpolation values can be logged to a .csv file, and a dynamic graph enables the user to visualize the interpolating Lagrange polynomial along with the interpolation points of their choosing. 

Note, the script comes with predetermined, statically defined data points from which the Lagrange Polynomials are generated. Future versions will enable reading from input files and generation of starting data points from user-entered values at prompt.

## Libraries and Modules
